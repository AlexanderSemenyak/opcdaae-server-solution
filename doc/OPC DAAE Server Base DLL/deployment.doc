<p>There are 2 main issues you need to be aware of when deploying your application to end users:</p>
<h2>Required Software Components</h2>
<p>Please be sure that the required software components are installed. If they are not yet installed please install the software as follows:</p>
<h3>OPC Core Components Redistributable</h3>
<p>This setup application installs the OPC Core Components required by applications based on the OPC DA/AE Server Solution DLL. Please use on of the following setups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\\Win32\\redist\\OPCCoreComponentsRedistributable if you use a 32bit server on a 32bit operating system</li>
  <li>\\x64\\redist\\OPCCoreComponentsRedistributable if you use a 32bit or 64bit server on 64bit operating systems</li>
</ul>
<h3>OPC DA/AE Server Solution DLL Components</h3>
<p>The OPC DA/AE Server Solution DLL creates one server executable, e.g. OpcDaAeServer.exe. You can find this file in the project directory. It should be copied to your application directory.</p>
<p>After successfully deploying your application you should check the security permission settings. </p>
<p>Most problems occur because of failures in these configuration settings. Some general hints are given in the Trouble Shooting Section.</p>
<h2>Register/Unregister the OPC Server</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Register<br/>
			You can use the following command to register the OPC Server: OpcDaAeServer.exe -regserver</li>
		<li>Register as Service<br/>
			You can use the following command to register the OPC Server as a service: OpcDaAeServer.exe -service</li>
		<li>Unregister<br/>
		You can use the following command to unregister the OPC Server: OpcDaAeServer.exe -unregserver</li>
	</ul>
</p>
